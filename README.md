# hometown_sarnia
A brief intro to my hometown of Sarnia, Ontario, Canada based on Scrimba's Frontend Development Career Path Module 2 [Solo Project](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend/solo-project-hometown-homepage-cob2e4812840974342ebb42eb)

The project requirements were using classes, flexbox, and a background image. It was to be modelled after this example:

Extras added include:
- a WEBP animated hero image blending 2 photos
- gradients for the h1 and card
- making it fully responsive
- an extra section on interesting facts

Here's a screenshot of the finished product:
